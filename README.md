Predicting Life Expectancy from Health Data - Databricks Data Science Machine Learning MLOps Demo

In this demo, we walk through a real-world data science and machine learning use case on Databricks, showing how different members of the data team can interact and collaborate on the Databricks platform.

We also show how MLflow on Databricks simplifies and streamlines the end-to-end machine learning workflow, using the MLflow tracking server to track and catalog each model training run, along with the MLflow Model Registry to shepherd ML models through testing and staging environments into production, directly from Databricks.
